# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 2, 2026  
**Developer:** Idra Informatica  
**Application:** PNetScanner

This Privacy Policy describes how **PNetScanner** handles information. Our guiding principle is simple: **your network data stays on your device.**

---

### 1. Data Collection and Usage
PNetScanner is a network diagnostic tool. All scanning activities are performed locally.

* **Local Processing:** All detection of IP addresses, MAC addresses, device names, and open ports is performed directly on your device.
* **Scan History:** The application saves a history of your previous scans locally on your device's internal storage. This data is **never** uploaded to our servers, nor is it accessible by Idra Informatica.
* **No Personal Data:** We do not collect names, emails, or any personally identifiable information (PII).

### 2. Permissions
To function correctly, PNetScanner requires:

* **Location Access:** On Android, access to Wi-Fi details (like SSID) requires location permissions. 
    * **Usage:** We use this exclusively to identify the current Wi-Fi network. 
    * **Privacy:** We **do not** track, record, or share your GPS coordinates or physical movements.

### 3. No Third-Party Integration
* **Ads:** PNetScanner is an Ad-free experience.
* **Analytics:** We do not use tracking SDKs (like Firebase or Google Analytics).
* **Cloud:** There is no cloud sync; your data is as secure as your physical device.

### 4. Data Retention
Since the scan history is stored locally, you have full control. You can delete specific scans or clear the entire history within the app settings. Uninstalling the app will automatically delete all locally stored data.
